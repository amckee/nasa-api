`nasa` provides a simple Python wrapper to interact with the [NASA Data APIs](https://data.nasa.gov/developer/external/planetary/). Full documentation for the APIs is available on [NASA's site](https://data.nasa.gov/developer/external/planetary/), and named parameters here are the same as there.

This is a fork which should be obvious. The plan with this fork is to extend it to further portions of NASA's API.

Usage
-----

[Acquire an API key](https://data.nasa.gov/developer/external/planetary/#apply-for-an-api-key) and set your API key as the NASA_API_KEY environment variable before using the API!
