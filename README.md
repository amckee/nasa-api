This is a fork of a repo that provides a simple Python wrapper to interact with the [NASA Data APIs](https://data.nasa.gov/developer/external/planetary/). It does not cover what I needed, so I forked it to add what I do need.

Full documentation for the APIs is available on [NASA's site](https://data.nasa.gov/developer/external/planetary/), and named parameters here are the same as there.

Usage
-----

[Acquire an API key](https://data.nasa.gov/developer/external/planetary/#apply-for-an-api-key) and set your API key as the NASA_API_KEY environment variable before using the API!

For further details, see original repo.
